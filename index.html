                <p>"A tale that's different from the rest: the thread unfurls against the clocks.
                    The one the Speaker loved the best must have a perfect paradox."</p>
                <p>The Perfect Paradox is the signature weapon of the legendary Saint-14, a Titan thought long lost
                    after
                    venturing through the Infinite Forest in search of the notorious Warlock, Osiris. True to the
                    weapon's
                    name, the Perfect Paradox is subject to myth in its own right; The weapon was supposedly in the
                    possession of the Guardian before being given to Saint-14 at an unspecified point in the past,
                    having
                    been forged in the present day[2]. To forge the weapon, the Guardian traveled to the Simulant Future
                    to
                    visit the Titan's grave and recover his personal effects. After the weapon was reforged using the
                    Infinite Forge, it was then bestowed back to him as it had originally. However, unable to navigate
                    or
                    escape the timelines of the Infinite Forest like Osiris could, Saint-14 remained stuck in his
                    timeline
                    and proceeds through the events leading to his death while holding the Perfect Paradox. The timeline
                    eventually progresses to the Simulant Future where the weapon is recovered by the Guardian, thus
                    repeating the cycle of its lifespan.</p>
